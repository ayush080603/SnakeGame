# 🐍 Snake Game – Python Edition

A classic **Snake Game** implemented in Python using the `pygame` library. This project was built to practice basic game development concepts and event handling in Python.

---

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** to control the snake’s direction.
- Eat the food to **grow longer** and earn points.
- Don’t collide with the **walls** or yourself — doing so ends the game.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pygame Library**

---

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time movement and input handling
- Score tracking system
- Game Over alert when the snake collides
- Smooth gameplay with increasing difficulty
- Clean and structured code using a single `main.py` file

## 📚 Learning
This game was developed to strengthen my understanding of:
  - Event handling
  - Loops and collisions
  - Game timing and refreshing logic
  - Python’s pygame module
